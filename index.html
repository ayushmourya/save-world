Earth is a 2007 nature documentary film which depicts the diversity of wild habitats and creatures across the planet. The film begins in the Arctic in January of one year and moves southward, concluding in Antarctica in the December of the same year. Along the way, it features the journeys made by three particular species—the polar bear, African bush elephant and humpback whale—to highlight the threats to their survival in the face of rapid environmental change. A companion piece to the 2006 BBC/Discovery television series Planet Earth, the film uses many of the same sequences, though most are edited differently, and features previously unseen footage.

    Planet Earth premiered on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and by June 2007 had been shown in 130 countries. The original version was narrated by David Attenborough, whilst some international versions used alternative narrators.

    From the frozen tundra in the north to the dry forests of the equator, Sir David Attenborough narrates a compelling view of the planet. "Planet Earth" was the first natural history documentary to be filmed in high definition, and now a decade later improved technology has made it possible to capture further details, from elusive animal behaviors to previously inaccessible remote landscapes. In addition to exploring the wilderness, the series examines urban dwellings, focusing on animals that have adapted to city life.

In the last 150 years the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has skyrocketed, particularly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. We know that these gases accelerate climate change because they trap heat in the atmosphere, thus producing an increase in the earth's average temperature. Professor Rubin explains in this article that environmental problems mostly require joint action to find an effective solution. Voluntary technological policy measures will not be sufficient to stabilize greenhouse gas levels. Sufficiently restrictive regulatory policy.

        Earth is home to millions of species. Just one dominates it. Us. Our cleverness, our inventiveness and our activities have modified almost every part of our planet. In fact, we are having a profound impact on it. Indeed, our cleverness, our inventiveness and our activities are now the drivers of every global problem we face. And every one of these problems is accelerating as we continue to grow towards a global population of 10 billion. In fact, I believe we can rightly call the situation we're in right now an emergency – an unprecedented planetary emergency.

        Friends of the Earth International (FoEI) is an international network of environmental organizations in 74 countries.

        Friends of the Earth was founded in 1969 in San Francisco by David Brower, Donald Aitken and Gary Soucie after Brower's split with the Sierra Clubdue to the latter's positive approach to nuclear energy. The founding donation of $500,000 (in 2019 USD) was provided by Robert Orville Anderson, the owner of Atlantic Richfield oil company.
        
        It became an international network of organisations in 1971 with a meeting of representatives from four countries, namely U.S., Sweden, the UK and France.

The NRDC was founded in 1970.Its establishment was partially an outgrowth of the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, 
the Storm King case. The case centered on Con Ed's plan to build the world's largest hydroelectric facility at Storm King Mountain. The proposed
 facility would have pumped vast amounts of water from the Hudson River to a reservoir and released it through turbines to generate electricity at peak
 demand. A dozen concerned citizens organized the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference in opposition to the project.

        The organization was founded in 1971 as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, though it was fully independent from the Sierra Club.
        It changed its name to Earthjustice in 1997 to better reflect its role as a legal advocate representing hundreds of regional, national and international
        organizations. As of September 2018, the group has provided free legal representation to more than 1,000 clients ranging from the Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund.
